# CTCI_python
Cracking the coding interview - misc. problems

This is a repo of me doing various CTCI problems in python, alongside relevant tests. Did I need to put this on github? nope... but I find holding myself accountable to something that I know has an odd chance of other people noticing is never a bad idea (:
